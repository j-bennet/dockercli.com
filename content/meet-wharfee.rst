Meet wharfee_ - previously named dockercli. It is a shell for Docker that can
do autocompletion and syntax highlighting, as well as some useful shortcuts.

I had to rename my tool to avoid stepping on any official trademarks and to
comply with a legal request_. Wharfie, according to wikipedia_, is a synonym
for someone who works in the docks. And I thought it's a cute word...
very important!
