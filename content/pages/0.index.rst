Dockercli provides a more convenient way to enter Docker commands. It
autocompletes commands and parameters as you type, and has syntax
highlighting.

Dockercli is an open source Python package. 

Code is available on github: https://github.com/j-bennet/dockercli

It can be installed from PyPi:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install dockercli

Then run it with:

.. code:: bash

    $ dockercli

Once you're inside the prompt, just type in your usual Docker commands,
except there's no need to prefix everything with "docker". Example:

.. code:: bash

    $ run --detach --name foo ubuntu:14.04
