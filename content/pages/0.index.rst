autocompletes commands and parameters as you type, and has syntax
highlighting.

Wharfee is an open source Python package.

Code is available on github: https://github.com/j-bennet/wharfee

It can be installed from PyPi:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install wharfee

Then run it with:

.. code:: bash

    $ wharfee

Once you're inside the prompt, just type in your usual Docker commands,
except there's no need to prefix everything with "docker". Example:

.. code:: bash

    $ run --detach --name foo ubuntu:14.04
